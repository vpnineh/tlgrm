### HiN VPN: Your Gateway to Secure and Free Internet Access

**HiN VPN** stands out as a pioneering open-source project designed to empower users with secure, unrestricted internet access.

3. **Open Source**: Being an open-source project, HiN VPN encourages collaboration and transparency. The source code is available for anyone to review, contribute to, or modify, ensuring that the service remains secure and up-to-date with the latest technological advancements.
    
4. **PHP and Python Backend**: The backend of HiN VPN is developed using PHP + Python (Thanks to @NekoHanaku), two widely-used server-side scripting language known for their flexibility and ease of use. This choice of technology ensures that the service can be easily maintained and scaled as needed.
